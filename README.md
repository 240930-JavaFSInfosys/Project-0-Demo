# Project-0-Demo

- This project will look AT LOT like a passing Project 0. It will hold your hand if you want. (Project 1 demo will not be as generous)

### Covered Concepts:

- DB table creation in DBeaver (Employees table depending on Roles table)
- Maven project with DB connection (See pom.xml for dependency, see ConnectionUtil for DB Connection logic)
- Java DAO Classes that communicate with the DB via JDBC and SQL commands (DML - insert, select, update, delete) (AKA the CRUD operations)
- Java Controller Classes that accept HTTP requests with Javalin
